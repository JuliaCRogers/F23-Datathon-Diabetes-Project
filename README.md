# F23-Datathon-Diabetes-Project
This project was part of UC Berkeley's Fall 2023 Datathon for Social Good, focusing on healthcare and public health. Participants were tasked with leveraging data science to address pertinent issues within this theme.

The challenge presented was to identify and devise solutions for problems in public health using diverse datasets, including COVID-19 data, healthcare worker data, and population health data.

With two years of Python experience and introductory machine learning knowledge, I took on this project to push my boundaries and enhance my statistical understanding and data visualization skills using Python.

In this project, I employed heatmap and scatterplot visualizations, along with a linear regression model, to predict a patient's risk of developing diabetes.

I welcome comments and feedback, as I actively immerse myself in learning data science concepts with the aim of applying them to future roles.
